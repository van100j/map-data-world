Map Data Across the Globe
=====================

[FCC's Map Data Across the Globe challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/map-data-across-the-globe):

1. Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/mVEJag.

2. Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

3. User Story: I can see where all Meteorites landed on a world map.

4. User Story: I can tell the relative size of the meteorite, just by looking at the way it's represented on the map.

5. User Story: I can mouse over the meteorite's data point for additional data.

6. Hint: Here's a dataset you can use to build this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FreeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/meteorite-strike-data.json
